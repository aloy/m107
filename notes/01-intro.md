# Honor Code

You may collaborate on homework but **you must submit your own assignment that reflects your own thinking, work and organization.**

To check if your homework meets this standard, imagine I asked you to explain your reasoning for each problemâ€”you should be able to do so with ease.


All assignments are considered to be pledged to this standard.

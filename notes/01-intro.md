# Homework

Assigned on Mondays (due Fridays by 4 pm) and Fridays (due Tuesdays by 4 pm). 

No late work will be accepted.

20% of grade. Lowest two dropped.

Exceptionally messy, hard to read, or unstapled homework will receive a 20% penalty. This penalty can be lifted by turning in a cleanly written copy, or a photo of you holding a stapler.

# Homework Grading Scale

4 = One problem is incomplete or contains a major conceptual flaw, but most problems are essentially correct. There may also be some minor errors or calculation mistakes.

3 = At least two problems are incomplete or contain a major conceptual flaw, but most problems are essentially correct. There may also be some minor errors or calculation mistakes.

# Homework Grading Scale

2 = More than half the problems are incomplete or contain a major conceptual flaw, but there is evidence that the student made a serious attempt to solve most problems. Some parts of some problems are correct.

1 = The assignment shows little progress toward a correct solution on any problem, but there is evidence that some serious effort was put forth on at least one problem.

# Honor Code

You may collaborate on homework but you must submit your own assignment that reflects your own thinking, work and organization.

To check if your homework meets this standard, imagine I asked you to explain your reasoning for each problem—you should be able to do so with ease.


All assignments are considered to be pledged to this standard.

# Computing

Modern statistics relies on the use of computers.

We will use the statistical language R to achieve our computational goals in this course. 

R is a command line program—it may seem confusing at first, but hang in there.

Install R and RStudio today so that you can resolve any issues before you need it for an assignment.

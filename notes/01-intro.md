# Honor Code

You may collaborate on homework but you must submit your own assignment that reflects your own thinking, work and organization.

To check if your homework meets this standard, imagine I asked you to explain your reasoning for each problemâ€”you should be able to do so with ease.


All assignments are considered to be pledged to this standard.

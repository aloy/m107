#[fit] Measures of
#[fit] Center

---

# Mean

Formula: $$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$


Interpretation: center of mass

<br>

Resistant?

---

# Median

Formula: 

- if $$n$$ is odd, then find the center value 
- if $$n$$ is even, then find the average of the two center values


Interpretation: center value (50th percentile)

<br>

Resistant?

# Outliers

When using statistics that are not resistant to outliers:

1. Check whether there was a data recording error

2. If there wasn't, check whether the outlier is part of the target population.

3. If it is, run analysis **with and without** the outlier. Report both analyses and on their differences.

# Percentiles

The $$p^{\text{th}}$$ percentils is the value that is greater than $$p%$$ of the data.

---

# Quartiles

**Quartiles** divide the ordered data into four equal parts.

# Standard deviation

Formula: $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$$

Interpretation: "average" distance a typical value falls from the mean <br>

Resistant?

---

# 95% rule

If a distribution is approximately symmetric and bell shaped, approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

---

# Interquartile range (IQR)

Formula: $$Q_3 - Q1$$ 

<br>

Interpretation: spread of the central 50% of the values

<br>

Resistant?

---

# Range

Formula: $$\max - \min$$ 

<br>

Interpretation: distance between the extremes

<br>

Resistant?

Why use "standard deviations" from the mean on the y-axis?

---

# Standardized values

The **z-score** is the number of standard deviations a value fall from the mean

For samples: $$z = \frac{x - \overline{x}}{s}$$

For populations: $$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

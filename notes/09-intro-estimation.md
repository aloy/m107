# Poll results

> The full sample of the Oct. 6-9 survey comprises 1,000 registered voters interviewed by cell phone or landline, with a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points. Results for likely voters are based on 878 respondents, with a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points. <br>

# Sampling distribution of a statistic

Distribution of a statistic calculated from different samples of size n drawn from the same population

<br>

Summarizes the behavior of the statistic calculated from n observations

# Example

The 2015 college scorecard data set comprised of the 1,776 non-profit colleges/universities in the U.S.

<br>

Average cost of attendance = µ = $31,336

# Properties

Centered around the true parameter if the sampling scheme is unbiased

# Standard error (SE)

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution

<br> 

Smaller for larger sample sizes

# Confidence intervals

For a bell-shaped sampling distribution 

ME ≈ 2 • SE for 95% confidence intervals

<br>

In our example SE ≈ 1913 for the sample of size n=50

---

# Interpreting confidence intervals

95% of all samples yield intervals that contain the true parameter, so we say that we are "95% confident" or "95% sure" that one interval contains the truth.

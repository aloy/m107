# [fit] The Normal
# [fit] Distribution

---

## Letâ€™s quickly look back at many of the randomization and bootstrap distributions that we have seen thus far in the course...

## Think about what these distributions have in common.

# The normal distribution, $$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$$

![left 170%](11-figs/normal_density.pdf)

Unimodal and symmetric 
(bell shaped) 
<br>

Total area under the curve is 1

<br>

Follows very strict guidelines about how the data are distributed around the mean

# 68-95-99.7 Rule

About 68% of the distribution falls within 1 SD of the mean

---

# 68-95-99.7 Rule


About 95% falls within 2 SD of the mean

---


# 68-95-99.7 Rule


About 99.7% falls within 3 SD of the mean

# 68-95-99.7 Rule


It is possible for observations to fall 4, 5, or more standard deviations away from the mean, but this is very rare if the data are nearly normal

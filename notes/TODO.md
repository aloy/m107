# Changes/questions for next time

- Add a lecture (15-20 minutes) on literate programming, then model using R and R markdown BEFORE lab 1.

- R Studio server doesn't play well with https:// urls... be aware of this for the coding!

- Is it easier to have students read data from the web? This seems to defeat some of the teaching of reproducible research...
